** Determine size (of code) of functions in a EXE/DLL by querying PDB files via the DIA SDK **

CodeSizer is a Win32 program written in C++.
It uses the DIA SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x93ctkx8%28v=vs.100%29.aspx)
provided by Microsoft. This SDK provides a layer of abstraction in parsing PDB files.

CodeSizer uses the DIA SDK to access a PDB file in order to determine the code size of functions.
By code size, I mean the size in bytes of the machine code of a function. This does not include
the stack/heap space used by the function, only the space occupied in the .text section.

Usage:
CodeSizer.exe /f <path_to_PDB/EXE/DLL> [/spath <searchpath_to_PDB>]
              [/a | /pfunc | /s <comma_sep_function_names> | /m <module_name> | /r <substring_to_match>]
Options:
/f        Specify the PDB/EXE/DLL path to use
/spath    When specifying EXE/DLL, if corresponding PDB file isn't in the
          same folder as the EXE/DLL, this is the search path for PDB.

/a        Display all functions' size
/pfunc    Display only functions that are public symbols.
          Use this for binaries that don't expose internal functions (ntdll.dll for eg.).
/s        Comma separated list of function names whose sizes must be displayed
/r        Display functions that have the specified string as a sub-string.
          This is case-sensitive.
/m        (Not supported yet) Display functions that are in the specified module/library.

/a, /s, /r and /m can all be specified at the same time.
